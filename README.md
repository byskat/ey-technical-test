## Try it out: Single command

```bash
# will install the dependencies, generate the code (SSG) and serve

$ yarn from-scratch
```
The project has been developed over Node 15.7


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Possible improvements

- Smooth grid item deletion (using js to reposition the tiles)
- Smart scroll -> save the position of the scroll when the user leaves (instead of starting over)
- Test properly ?
